  // Platform messages are asynchronous, so we initialize in an async method.
  Future<void> initPlatformState() async {
    // If the widget was removed from the tree while the asynchronous platform
    // message was in flight, we want to discard the reply rather than calling
    // setState to update our non-existent appearance.
